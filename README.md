# PSOLinux
PSO - An Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization, in progress.

- <insert more contextual info and function here >

main.cpp - as name suggests
ODE.cpp - contains ode systems that are tested
calc.cpp - contains all calculation functions used and functions needed for rng generation
fileIO.cpp - as named suggests
var.cpp - contains all necessary global variables used


Naming Conventions for variables, functions, structs/classes.

Variables = Camel Case - i.e hereIsAVariable
Functions = lowercase underscore with verb in front - i.e create_Function();
    - exceptions: ODE systems of equations to be solved may not have a verb in front.
Structs/Classes = Uppercase underscore - i.e This_Is_A_Class
